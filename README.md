# ML-Brushup

Inviting collaboration.


I will compile and add all the unique points.All collaborators will appear names will be inclused in the final draft. 

**Day Zero(2/12/2018): Familiarize yourself with the tools**

New to github? [quick start guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) <br>
Fork this repository<br>
Edit the .md files of the topics.<br>
or upload a ipython notebook.<br>
then commit to your forked repository<br>
raise a pull request so i can update this repository<br>

LATEX will be helpful to type the mathematical stuff.<br>
refer [Producing Mathematical Formulae using LaTeX](https://www.maths.tcd.ie/~dwilkins/LaTeXPrimer/) <br>
if you want to insert hand written snipet of formulas, just upload them in the photos folder and use the link.<br>
